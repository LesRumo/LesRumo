    <h1>About Me</h1>

        I am Lesedi Shirami, i was born and raised in Limpopo Polokwane. Growing up i wanted to become a doctor then it
        changed to a teacher then it changed to a social worker. Then it changed to me wanting be a financial economist, but
        unfortunately i chose the science stream in high school. Then i didnt know what i wanted to be, i was okay with not
        knowing as long i passed my subjects.
    </p>

    <p>
        Then i was in grade 12 applying for varsity and i didnt know what i wanted to do.All i knew is that i loved Mathematics.So i listened to everyone around me that
        told me what i should become.The applied for medicine even though my physics was not good and computer science. Got rejected
        for medicine and was accepted for computer science. Thats where my journey started of discovering what i wanted to do.

    </p>

    <p>
        I got accepted to study computer science at the University of Pretoria. That year was one of the most crazy depressing
        and funny year. The only thing i enjoyed was my mathematics modules and later in that year that when i found out that you study
        mathematics as a degree. I changed my degree the following year to Applied mathematics and mathematical Statistics. In the end i
        graduated with an undergrad degree in Applied Mathematics and an honours degree in Mathematical Statistics. So now if anyone asks me want to
        be when i "grow up", i can confidently tell them that i want to be a Doctor, a maths doctor.

        I created this page to take you anyone that is interested on my career and on my quest of discovering who Lesedi is. I will be uploading here
        every week, i have a podcast and a youtube channel. The link to the youtube channel and podcast are on the contact page.

    <p>Hopefully i did not bore you, you can send me emails if there is a topic you want to me talk about or if you want to hire me for a job. </p>
